# ft_linalg

ft_linalg is a lightweight linear algebra library implemented in C, designed for simple transformations and projections in graphics programming.

## Features

- Vector and matrix operations using union-based structures
- Support for 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors
- Support for 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 matrices
- Basic vector operations (addition, dot product, cross product, normalization)
- Basic matrix operations (multiplication, transpose, inverse)
- Simple transformation functions (translation, rotation, scaling)
- Projection matrix creation (orthographic, perspective)
